Test case, Copy Constructor: same members, same size, different pointers (deep copy):
Copy constructor passed!

Test case, Copy Constructor: 1 member:
Copy constructor passed!

Test case, Copy Constructor: zero members:
Copy constructor passed!

Test case, Copy Constructor: table size less than 0:
Copy constructor passed!

Measuring the efficiency of insertion functionality:
Inserting 1000000 members took 6416 clock ticks (0.006416 seconds)!
Inserting 4000000 members took 26758 clock ticks (0.026758 seconds)!
Inserting 16000000 members took 98133 clock ticks (0.098133 seconds)!
Inserting 64000000 members took 374367 clock ticks (0.374367 seconds)!

Here is an example of a table:
i i r e l o i b f p 
# u g e r q s h k m
